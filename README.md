The AI-powered Resume Screening and Ranking System is designed to automate the initial screening of resumes, helping recruiters efficiently shortlist candidates based on their relevance to a given job description. 
The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity, to analyze the textual content of resumes and compare them with job descriptions.
How It Works:
The recruiter enters the job description into the system.
PDF resumes are uploaded to the platform.
The system extracts text from each resume.
TF-IDF Vectorization converts the extracted text into numerical features.
Cosine Similarity measures how closely each resume matches the job description.
The system ranks resumes in descending order of similarity and presents the results.
Technology Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used:
PyPDF2 (for extracting text from PDFs)
Scikit-learn (for TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity)
Streamlit (for UI development)
Pandas (for handling data and displaying results)
Project Benefits:
Saves Time: Automates the manual screening process.
Enhances Accuracy: Uses AI-driven ranking to improve candidate selection.
Removes Bias: Ensures an objective, data-driven shortlisting process.
User-Friendly: Provides an interactive, easy-to-use interface for recruiters.
Potential Improvements & Future Work:
Implement deep learning models like BERT for better semantic understanding.
Add multi-language support for resumes in different languages.
Integrate named entity recognition (NER) to extract key resume details.
Support image-based resumes using OCR technology.
This system revolutionizes recruitment by making resume screening faster, smarter, and more efficient!
